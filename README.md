# VRCWhitelist
A whitelist mod for VRChat.

## Install instructions
### 1. Install melonloader
### 2. Install the mod

## Usage
### Create a text file named "whitelist.txt" in the vrchat installation folder (where vrchat.exe is).
### There, add VRChat user ids, one per line, to the file.
### Everyone not on the list will not exist for you ingame.

## Controls
### F8 to disable the whitelist (you'll need to leave and join the instance for the changes to apply).
### F9 to save a whitelist snapshot of the users in the current instance to the vrchat install folder. This snapshot will be named `vrcwhitelist_snapshot_<time of snapshot>.txt`.
